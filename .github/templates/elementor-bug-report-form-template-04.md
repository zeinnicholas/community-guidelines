### 📋 Requirements

For a quick review and efficient resolution, please ensure your report meets the following requirements:

- *️⃣ **All fields in this form are required** — no exceptions. <br>Incomplete issues will be closed without further action.

- 🔍 **Search for similar issues before opening a new one.** <br>Avoid duplicates and save time by using the **[filters at the top of the Issues list](#)** to narrow your search.

- 🆕 **Ensure you have the latest stable versions installed.** <br>Including Elementor, Elementor Pro, WordPress core, your active theme, and all installed plugins. <br>👉 Stay updated: **[Elementor Changelogs](https://elemn.to/changelog)**

- 🗑️ **Clear all relevant cache layers.** <br>Confirm the issue is not being caused by stale or cached data. <br>Please clear server cache, site-level cache (including plugin-based cache), CDN cache, and your browser cache — in that order.

- 🕵️ **Test with only Elementor, Elementor Pro, and the Hello Theme active.** <br>Temporarily disable all other plugins and themes. This step helps confirm that the issue is not being caused by a 3rd-party conflict. <br>👉 Reference: **[Troubleshooting the Editor](https://elemn.to/help-troubleshooting)**

- 💾 **Copy and paste your complete Elementor System Info.** <br>This is not optional and helps us better reproduce and understand your issue. Reports without the full Elementor System Info will be closed. <br>👉 Learn how to copy it here: **[Share system information with Elementor](https://elemn.to/help-system-info)**

- 🪪 **If you’re a 3rd-party developer**, please introduce yourself. <br>Include your name, company, product name, and a way for us to contact you (such as an email address) if needed. <br>This helps us collaborate more effectively.

- ☝️ **Only one issue per report.** <br>Please don’t bundle multiple bugs in a single submission. This helps us track, reproduce, and fix each issue accurately.
<br>
<br>

### 🎯 Scope

To keep this repository focused and efficient, there are some types of reports that we are unable to handle here. These types of issues will be **closed without further action**. 

- 🛟 **Requests for personal support** <br>This includes help with setup, troubleshooting, or usage guidance. For that, please contact our **[official support channels](https://elemn.to/support-ticket)**.

- 🧩 **Conflicts with 3rd-party plugins, themes, or services.** <br>We’re only able to address issues related to Elementor and Elementor Pro directly.

- 🚀 **Feature requests or suggestions.** <br>We love your ideas! But this form is only for confirmed bugs. Please use the dedicated Feature Request form instead. <br>See: **[Request a Feature](#)**

- 📚 **Questions about custom code or extending Elementor.** <br>We cannot provide assistance with writing or debugging custom code. If you’re building with the Elementor API, we recommend using our **[Developers Documentation](https://elemn.to/dev-docs)**.

- 🛡️ **Security and vulnerability disclosures.** <br>We take security seriously. Please use our managed [Bug Bounty Programs](https://elemn.to/bug-bounty) to responsibly report security issues.
