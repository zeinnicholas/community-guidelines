### 📋 Requirements

For a quick review and efficient resolution, please ensure your report meets the following requirements:

- *️⃣ **All fields in this form are required.** — no exceptions. <br>Incomplete issues will be closed without further action.

- 🔍 **Search for similar issues before opening a new one.** <br>Avoid duplicates and save time by using the **[editor-v4](https://github.com/elementor/elementor/labels/product%2Feditor-v4)** label to narrow your search.

- 🗑️ **Clear all relevant cache layers.** <br>Confirm the issue is not being caused by stale or cached data. <br>Please clear server cache, site-level cache (including plugin-based cache), CDN cache, and your browser cache — in that order.

- 🕵️ **Test with only Elementor, Elementor Pro, and the Hello Theme active.** <br>Temporarily disable all other plugins and themes. This step helps confirm that the issue is not being caused by a 3rd-party conflict. <br>👉 Reference: **[Troubleshooting the Editor](https://elemn.to/help-troubleshooting)**

- 💾 **Copy & Paste your complete Elementor System Info.** <br>This is not optional and helps us better reproduce and understand your issue. Reports without the full Elementor System Info will be closed. <br>👉 Learn how to copy it here: **[Share system information with Elementor](https://elemn.to/help-system-info)**

- 🪪 **If you’re a 3rd-party developer**, please introduce yourself. <br>Include your name, company, product name, and a way for us to contact you (such as an email address) if needed. <br>This helps us collaborate more effectively.

- ☝️ **Only one issue per report.** <br>Please don’t bundle multiple bugs in a single submission. This helps us track, reproduce, and fix each issue accurately.
<br>
<br>

### 🎯 Scope

To keep this repository focused and efficient, there are some types of reports that we are unable to handle here. These types of issues will be **closed without further action**. 

- 🐞 **Issues unrelated to bugs in the Editor V4.** <br>If you're here to report issues with existing features of Elementor V3, please **[use our general 🐞 Bug Report form instead](#)**.

- 🛟 **Requests for personal support** <br>This includes help with setup, troubleshooting, or usage guidance. For that, please contact our **[official support channels](https://elemn.to/support-ticket)**.

- 🧩 **Conflicts with 3rd-party plugins, themes, or services.** <br>We’re only able to address issues related to Elementor and Elementor Pro directly. If the problem occurs when using a plugin, theme, or integration that is not officially supported by Elementor, please reach out to the 3rd-party provider for assistance.

- 🚀 **Feature requests or suggestions.** <br>We love your ideas! But this form is only for confirmed bugs. Please use the dedicated Feature Request form instead. <br>See: **[Request a Feature](#)**

- 📚 **Questions about custom code or extending Elementor.** <br>We cannot provide assistance with writing or debugging custom code. If you’re building with the Elementor API, we recommend using our **[Developers Documentation](https://elemn.to/dev-docs)**.

- 🛡️ **Security and vulnerability disclosures.** <br>We take security seriously. Please use our managed [Bug Bounty Programs](https://elemn.to/bug-bounty) to responsibly report security issues.

- ☹️ **Complaints or offensive content.** <br>This is not the place to submit complaints about Elementor’s products or services. We also do not tolerate offensive, discriminatory, or hostile remarks. Please keep discussions respectful as outlined in our **[Code of Conduct](#)**.

- ❌ **Incomplete, invalid, or out-of-scope reports.** <br>Issues without clear steps to reproduce, missing required fields, or unrelated to Elementor or Elementor Pro will be closed without further action.
